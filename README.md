- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @noorgarawi, I work as a data scientist full-time, consulting on various client projects at the moment. 

Some projects you can find on my GitHub:
- ðŸŒ± I ventured into front-end development for the EdTech web-app I created for the Code First Girls' community hackathon
- ðŸ‘€ I worked on a personal project to predict house prices across London boroughs ðŸ˜ƒ
